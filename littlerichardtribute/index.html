      <li><strong>1945</strong> - Forced to move out of family home at age 13 due to his father's disdain for his early signs of homosexuality. He was taken in by a white family who owned a club in Macon, where Richard eventually began performing and honing his talent.</li>
      <li><strong>1947</strong> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Rosetta_Tharpe" target="_blank">Sister Rosetta Tharpe</a> overheard the fourteen-year-old Richard singing her songs before a performance at the Macon City Auditorium. She invited him to open her show. After the show, Tharpe paid him, inspiring him to become a professional performer.</li>
      <li><strong>1950</strong> - Richard joined his first musical band, Buster Brown's Orchestra, where Brown gave him the name <strong>Little Richard</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>1952</strong> - His father, "Bud" was killed after a confrontation outside a bar. Moving to Houston, he formed a band called the Tempo Toppers, performing as part of blues package tours in Southern clubs.</li>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - Hooked up with Specialty Records producer Art Rupe, who’d been hunting for a piano-pounding frontman to lead a group of musicians in New Orleans. In September, Richard stepped into the recording studio and pumped out <em>“Tutti Frutti,”</em> which became an instant hit, crossing over to the pop charts in both the United States and overseas in the United Kingdom.</li>
      <li><strong>1956</strong> - His next hit single, <em>"Long Tall Sally"</em> hit No. 1 on the Billboard Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers chart.</li>
      <li><strong>1957</strong> - Richard's first album, <em>"Here's Little Richard"</em>, was released by Specialty and peaked at number thirteen on the Billboard Top LPs chart. That year, he scored more hit success with songs such as <em>"Jenny, Jenny"</em> and <em>"Keep-A-Knockin'"</em> the latter becoming his first top ten single on the Billboard Top 100</li>
      <li><strong>1958</strong> -  Fueled by his earlier connections to the church, he abruptly and publicly quit performing rock and committed himself to the ministry and recording gospel songs. He formed the Little Richard Evangelistic Team, traveling across the country to preach</li>
